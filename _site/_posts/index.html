          <p>You look at that new App you just downloaded from the Play Store and you have no idea what went into building that App. Well I am here to tell you ... a LOT!</p>
<p>I messed up today ...(what else is new) and I had to delete the files from my "Hello World App" from my blog pages. Well... my little ole "Hello World App" that does not do a thing but print out whatever you type in it had ...wait for it.... 175 files that I had to delete.</p>
<p>The worst part of it all was I had to delete each and every single file manually because I couldn't remember how to do it in the bash ...shell or whatever name it goes by. I forgot and now I have to go re-learn how to use the program again. Life is just peachy!</p>
