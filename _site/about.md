There isn't much to say about me apart from that I love technology. I believe when used the right way they make our lives much easier but used the wrong way and you may be feeling you want to dissappear of the face of the earth. 

I decided to learn to build Apps out of a personal need and with a lot of coaching from my eldest son. My son got it into his head that I can do this (me ... not so sure) but now it is a test for me to see if I can really pull it off.

* To document my App building journey.
* To provide a reference source for any other "novice" who may be trying to do the exact same thing. 
* As a reference to my work accomplishment.

When I am not on GitHub tinkering with code I can be found doing my other favorite thing ... which is building WordPress Sites. My latest project is:
